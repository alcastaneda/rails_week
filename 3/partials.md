```bash
touch app/views/layouts/sidebar.html.erb
```

Take this template and add it into the `sidebar.html.erb`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Sidebar Template</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>My Website</h1>  
    <ul>
      <li>Menu 1</li>
      <li>Menu 2</li>
      <li>Menu 3</li>
      <li>Menu 4</li>
    </ul>
  </header>
  <main>
    <%= yield %>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <ul>
      <li>About us</li>
      <li>Team</li>
      <li>Terms and conditions</li>
    </ul>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

This will help us to differentiate the layouts.

In the controller method `index`, add this to the end of the method:

```ruby
render layout: "sidebar"
```

This line will just tell Rails to use the same logic of template rendering, but instead of using the default `application.html.erb`, it will render the template inside `sidebar.html.erb`.

#### Using partials

A best practice is to always keep every template as small as possible. A rule of thumb would be to keep shorter than 50 lines, for the sake of readability.

So for example, if your website has a layout with a top menu, the content and then the footer, this should all be in the layout, as it is rendered on every page.  But if all this html is in one file, the layout will end up being 200+ lines of code.

When this happens, you should think about splitting the template into partials. Partials are just chunks of a template that will be rendered into another one, like children of the layout.

This layout in `sidebar.html.erb` will soon be too long and unreadable, thus we need to split into different parts:

Create a new file: 

```bash
mkdir app/views/application
touch app/views/application/_header.html.erb
```

And inside move the following from `sidebar.html.erb`:

```erb
<header>
  <h1>My Website</h1>  
  <ul>
    <li>Menu 1</li>
    <li>Menu 2</li>
    <li>Menu 3</li>
    <li>Menu 4</li>
  </ul>
</header>
```

Now let's create another file:

```bash
touch app/views/application/_footer.html.erb
```

And inside move the following from `sidebar.html.erb`:

```erb
<footer>
  <ul>
    <li>About us</li>
    <li>Team</li>
    <li>Terms and conditions</li>
  </ul>
</footer>
```

Now the main `sidebar.html.erb` file is back to a normal size, we just need to include the partials and the final result will then be the same than before.

**Note:** Every partial needs to have an underscore as the first character - this way Rails knows that it is not a proper template but only a partial that will be included in a template.

Let's now call the partials in the layout:

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Sidebar Template</title>
</head>
<body>
  <%= render "header" %>
  <main>
    <%= yield %>
  </main>
  <%= render "footer" %>
</body>
</html>
```

Rails will automatically look in the folder `app/views/application/` for a file that is called by the name given to the method `render` with an underscore before it.
